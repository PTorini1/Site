# DiarioDeClasse
Website developed for my System Development course in SENAI during the first semester

My group was supposed to develop a Class Dairy website
As we had not studied backend in this part of the course yet, we just made the visual parts
The website is divided in home page, students secction and teachers section

The most part of the styles has been done in the own HTML files.
